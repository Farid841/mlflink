# Tutorial and template package to create Fink Science modules using MlFlow

## Dev notes
- `mlflow_local_run_example.py` and `send_run_to_fink_example.py` could be turned into jupyter notebooks so can include screenshots of where things (like artifacts) are in the MLFlow UI. 
- Need better example data so can train a quick model that makes sense 
- Need an intro (here in the README or in a notebook) explaining what can be changed and shouldn't be changed in this template package.
